# _Retail Store Sales_
## _Overview_
This repository contains a comprehensive project for analyzing and predicting retail store profits. The project integrates SQL, Python, and Tableau to clean, analyze, visualize data, and build predictive models. The goal is to provide actionable insights to improve decision-making and optimize profits in retail settings.

## _Project Workflow_
#### 1. Data Cleaning
#### Used SQL for:
#### Cleaning raw sales data.
#### Structuring and organizing datasets.
#### Performing initial exploratory queries.
#### Addressed missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
2. Data Analysis and Visualization
Leveraged Python for:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.
Uncovered key trends and patterns influencing sales and profits.
Created interactive dashboards in Tableau to:
Visualize sales trends, regional performance, and category-level insights.
Share findings in an intuitive, business-friendly format.
3. Predictive Modeling
Developed machine learning models in Python to forecast profits:
Linear Regression for baseline predictions.
Random Forest for handling non-linear patterns and feature interactions.
Evaluated models using metrics such as:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Mean Squared Error (MSE).
